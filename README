AlcaSync
========

This is a library for synchronisation with Alcatel 50x/70x mobiles. This
package also contains some samples how to use it. For more complex samples
have a look at KAlcatel application.

Subdirectories
==============

This tarball should contain following subdirectories:

alcademo - demo application for AlcaSync
alcatest - test application, used for examining protocol
lib      - AlcaSync library
settty   - tool for setting tty device parameters, it is probably useless for
           you, but I'm too lazy to remove it when creating tarball
